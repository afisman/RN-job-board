In practice this means leveraging cloud delivery, modern tech stacks, machine learning, and hand-crafted native app experiences on all of our platforms. We aim to deliver a rock solid experience on the streaming basics, while cooking up next generation multi-screen and multi-user playback experiences.Roku at PhiloThe Roku team at Philo is responsible for building our product experience on one of the biggest platforms in streaming TV: Roku streaming devices and Roku-enabled smart TVs. Philo’s Roku app has been a crucial platform for us since the Philo service first launched – Roku was our first “10-foot” (streaming TV device) platform and is one of our largest platforms by minutes watched. Historically, Roku has also been one of our primary platforms for prototyping nascent Philo features.We’re a small autonomous team building apps with high engagement and millions of installs, which collectively are responsible for a huge fraction of the billions of minutes watched on Philo each year. We are passionate about crafting the best possible UX to connect our users with the content they love, providing a seamless viewing experience while surprising them with new features and capabilities. We’re highly focused on optimizing the 10-Foot Experience, and you will directly contribute to that effort. By joining the Roku team, you will be working on TV platforms at a TV company (‍), allowing you to make a large impact on Philo product design and development.Recent projects on our Roku platform have included:Building the Philo Connect feature, a cross-platform second-screen experience that lets you fully control your large screen (“Ten foot”) viewing experience from your smartphone, maintaining a synchronized playback session that lets you browse for new content while controlling your current content playback. This technology is also the building block for potential future co-viewing features.Leading development of the Streams feature at Philo. Streams surfaces on-demand assets in an algorithmic, personalized, linear-like autoplay experience on the Philo Guide.Adding the capability to allow playback of upcoming FAST content discovered in Roku Search without requiring users to sign up or subscribe.About youAre you ready to grow your UI skills beyond the browser and into the living room?
